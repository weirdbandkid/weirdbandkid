# Hi, I'm *weirdbandkid*
I am a college student that is currently studying Cyber Security and Networking. I was the top of my class at my technical school during high school. I studied Cisco Networking and Cyber Security while I was there.

I am a self-taught programmer in JavaScript, Bash, Batch, Powershell, and more. I wouldn't call myself good programmer any kind. If the code works it works. Am I right?

# Background/Experience
 - I am the IT Manager & SysAdmin over at [Storm Server Hosting](https://stormserverhosting.com). There I manage all internal and external systems, such as Proxmox, Active Directory, KVM Hypervisors, web servers, Docker Hosts, and a lot more.
 - I also work at my college as an IT Services Desk assistant, where I work on the help desk answering phone calls, helping walkup users, and creating tickets.
